# My dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles for Hyprland.

The setup is far from finished/mature/stable/etc., so better to consider it as
a source of inspiration.

## Requirements

I use this programs:
```
- Hyprland
- Waybar
- Kitty
- Swaybg
- Swayidle
- Swaylock-effects
- Copyq
- wofi
- dunst
```
My setup usually consists in an external monitor on the left of my laptop.
