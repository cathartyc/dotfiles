# My dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles.

The setup is far from finished/mature/stable/etc., so it's better to consider it as
a source of inspiration.

## Requirements

My configs are related to:
```
- Hyprland
- i3 + picom
- Waybar
- Kitty
- Swaybg
- Hypridle
- Hyprlock
- Clipse
- SwayOSD
- Ranger
- Flameshot + grimshot (going to drop the latter soon)
- Neovim (soon)
```
My setup usually consists in an external monitor on the left of my laptop, controlled
via DDC.
